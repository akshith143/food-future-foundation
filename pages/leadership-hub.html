        <h2 class="leadership-head">OBJECTIVE</h2>
        <div class="leadership-line"></div>
        <p class="leadership-data">Food Systems Leaders Programme (FSLP) is aimed at creating a pool of young
            professionals
            working together to transform food system in India and beyond. Targeting early career
            professionals with diverse backgrounds in food and agriculture sector, the programme seeks to
            leverage energy, youth, and altruism of the young people. This would enable them to undertake
            a unique personal transformation and leadership journey and make a difference at national and
            global level. This would also provide high-impact, hands-on experiences to prepare them for
            meaningful and productive careers.</p>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
            <p class="leadership-data">
                Given that the food systems are changing rapidly and highly interconnected -- the most and the
                best knowledge about &quot;what to do&quot; resides collectively with the people who work in various
                parts
                of the system. Each of them has different parts of the knowledge, a different framework, a
                different set of understandings, and different information from the network of communications
                and information. Each sees different pieces of the future. This programme would access the
                knowledge and insights not only in its collective form but in its synergistic form and help the
                participants to find solutions for the future that reside collectively in the food system.
            </p>
            <p class="leadership-data">
                As the food system grows further, becomes more complex, more interconnected, and more
                interdependent, we must be able to look at the whole system and understand its parts all at
                once. We must be able to ask “what-if” questions about possible future and be creative and
                courageous about system redesign. The Programme aims to enable the participants to see
                things, think about things and do things differently.
            </p>
            <p class="leadership-data">Overall, the Programme is designed to develop leadership capacity for food system
                transformation, provide strong action orientation through ability to design and implement action-
                oriented projects and develop a network of young leaders who would take the mantle of food
                system transformation in India and globally.</p>

                    (MSCFSC). This Network will grow and expand over time. The Network’s overall goal is to build

                    discussions, generate ideas and act to strengthen food systems, and share information to
                    ensure anyone with an interest in food systems at all levels can engage with the Summit.</p>
                <p class="leadership-data">
                    The Network will help forming connections and building lasting relationships. As a bridge
